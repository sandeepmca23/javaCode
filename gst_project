E Way Bill:
+++++++++++++
   E-Way Bill is also on its way now. E-way Bill is an electronic document which the taxpayers would need to move their goods freely throughout the country. It can be easily generated on the e-way Bill Portal.
A Registered Person who wants to move his goods or services or both worth more than Rs. 50,000 will require an e-way bill now. Once e-way bill is generated, a 12 digit unique e-way Bill number (EBN) will be available to the transporter, recipient and the supplier. It can also be generated or cancelled through SMS.
Movement of goods may be in term of supply or inward supply from an unregistered person or other than supply say a return. Supply can be made with consideration or without consideration and it includes sales, transfer, barter/exchange etc. E-way bills must be generated for all these types of movements on the common portal.
From Today i.e. 1st Feb, 2018 E-way bill has been made mandatory under GST for all type of inter-state movements of goods. The main intention of the government for the implementation of this electronic document is to prevent the tax evasion and to track the status of movement of goods across the country.
Except for Lakshadweep, all the States and Union Territories have welcomed the e-way Bill System. Further, 13 States have also agreed to introduce E-way Bill for the Intra State movements of goods.
