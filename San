Hi Team ,

 

Ess protal is accessible now and also attendance is getting captured correctly .

 

Previously I had a problem in accessing the portal due to whch for past 2 weeks (18thMarch – 31st March) attendance was not captured and hence the time is not showing up in ESS.

I cannot regularise attendance from my end as monthly regularization is restricted to three attempts .

 

Kindly update the time for attendance from 18thMarch – 31st March 2020 and let me know .

 

 

Thanks,

Sandeep
